# Developing a .NET Core console app using DocumentDB
This sample shows you how to use the Microsoft Azure DocumentDB service to store and access data from a .NET Core console application.

For a complete end-to-end walkthrough of creating this application, please refer to the [full tutorial on the Azure documentation page](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-dotnetcore-get-started/).

## Running this sample

1. Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
* An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
    * Alternatively, you can use the [Azure DocumentDB Emulator](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-nosql-local-emulator) for this tutorial.
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) and .NET Core 1.1
    * If you're working on MacOS or Linux, you can develop .NET Core apps from the command-line by installing the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos) for the plaform of your choice. 
    * If you're working on Windows, you can develop .NET Core apps from the command-line by installing the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). 
    * You can use your own editor, or download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free and works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. 

2. Clone this repository using Git for Windows (http://www.git-scm.com/), or download the zip file.

3. If using the DocumentDB Emulator, please follow instructions at [Azure DocumentDB Emulator](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-nosql-local-emulator) to install and start the emulator.

If using your Azure DocumentDB account, please substitute the endpoint and authorization key in Program.cs with your account's details.

4. From a command prompt or shell, run `dotnet restore` followed by `dotnet run` to run the sample.
